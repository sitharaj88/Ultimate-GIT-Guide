# Git Sandbox: Try Stashing - Safely Manage Uncommitted Changes

This section provides a **safe sandbox environment** to experiment with Git stashing techniques. Git stashing allows developers to save uncommitted changes temporarily, enabling them to switch contexts or branches without losing work.

## 1. Understanding Git Stashing

### 1.1 What Is Git Stash?

**Git stash** saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) to a stack-like storage. It allows you to clean your working directory while preserving changes for later retrieval.

### 1.2 Why Use Git Stash?
- **Context Switching:** Quickly switch branches without committing incomplete work.
- **Clean Working Directory:** Prepare for operations like merges or pulls without losing progress.
- **Experimentation:** Test new ideas without affecting your current work.

> **Tip:** Git stash is ideal when you need to shift focus without losing your progress.

## 2. Basic Git Stashing Commands

### 2.1 Stash Uncommitted Changes
- **Stash all changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```
- **Stash with a message:**
  ```bash
  git stash save "WIP: new feature implementation"
  ```

### 2.2 Viewing Stashes
- **List all stashed changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash list
  ```
*Example output:*
```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: a1b2c3d Implement new feature
```

### 2.3 Applying Stashes
- **Apply the latest stash:**
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```
- **Apply a specific stash:**
  ```bash
  git stash apply stash@{2}
  ```

### 2.4 Removing Stashes
- **Drop a specific stash:**
  ```bash
  git stash drop stash@{0}
  ```
- **Clear all stashes:**
  ```bash
  git stash clear
  ```

## 3. Advanced Git Stashing Techniques

### 3.1 Stashing Staged and Untracked Files
- **Include untracked files:**
  ```bash
  git stash -u
  ```
- **Include ignored files:**
  ```bash
  git stash -a
  ```

### 3.2 Creating a Branch from Stash
- **Apply stash and create a new branch:**
  ```bash
  git stash branch new-feature-branch stash@{0}
  ```

### 3.3 Applying and Dropping in One Command
- **Pop stash (apply + drop):**
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  ```
*Use case:* Efficiently apply stashed changes and remove them from the stash list.

## 4. Handling Merge Conflicts During Stash Apply

### 4.1 Identifying Conflicts
- After applying a stash, conflicts may occur. Git will show:
  ```
  CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file>
  ```

### 4.2 Resolving Conflicts
- **Resolve manually:** Edit files to fix conflicts.
- **Mark as resolved:**
  ```bash
  git add <resolved-file>
  git commit -m "Resolved conflict after stash apply"
  ```

## 5. Best Practices for Git Stashing

- **Use Descriptive Messages:** Identify stashes easily with meaningful descriptions.
- **Avoid Long-Term Stashing:** Apply stashes promptly to prevent confusion.
- **Check Before Clearing:** Ensure stashes are no longer needed before running `git stash clear`.
- **Stash Selectively:** Use `git stash -p` for interactive stashing.
- **Document Complex Changes:** If stashing significant progress, document the context.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Stashing Issues

### 6.1 Lost Stash After Clearing
- **Recovery may be difficult.** Always double-check with `git stash list` before clearing.

### 6.2 Stash Conflicts with Rebased Changes
- If stashed changes conflict after rebase:
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  ```
- Resolve conflicts manually, then:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolve conflicts after applying stash"
  ```

### 6.3 Missing Changes After Pop
- If `git stash pop` fails, the stash remains in the list. Reapply with:
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

## 7. Real-World Use Cases

- **Urgent Bug Fixes:** Stash ongoing work to fix critical issues on another branch.
- **Context Switching:** Switch between tasks seamlessly without losing progress.
- **Code Reviews:** Prepare a clean working directory when reviewing pull requests.
- **Experimental Changes:** Test experimental code without affecting the main branch.

---

## 8. Summary

- **Stash Changes:** `git stash` and `git stash save "message"`
- **View Stashes:** `git stash list`
- **Apply Stashes:** `git stash apply [stash@{n}]`
- **Remove Stashes:** `git stash drop [stash@{n}]` or `git stash clear`
- **Advanced Usage:** `git stash -u`, `git stash branch`, and `git stash pop`

Git stashing is a powerful feature that boosts productivity by enabling seamless context switching and efficient task management. Experimenting with stashing techniques in the sandbox environment ensures developers are prepared to handle real-world scenarios confidently.
