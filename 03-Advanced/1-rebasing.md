# Git Rebasing: Streamlining Your Commit History

This guide covers the concept, use cases, and detailed commands related to Git rebasing. Rebasing is a powerful tool that helps maintain a clean, linear commit history, simplifying collaboration and code review.

## 1. Understanding Git Rebase

### 1.1 What is Git Rebase?

`git rebase` is a Git command that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing applies commits from one branch onto another, resulting in a linear commit history.

### 1.2 Why Use Rebase?
- **Cleaner History:** Creates a linear project history without merge commits.
- **Simplified Review:** Easier to understand the progression of changes.
- **Conflict Management:** Handle conflicts during rebase, reducing issues during future merges.

> **Tip:** Use rebase for local feature branch updates before pushing to remote repositories.

## 2. Basic Rebasing

### 2.1 Rebasing a Feature Branch onto Main
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
*Use case:* Bring your feature branch up to date with the latest changes from the main branch.

### 2.2 Resolving Rebase Conflicts
- Git will stop at conflicting commits.
- Resolve the conflict in the affected files, then:
```bash
git add <resolved-file>
git rebase --continue
```

### 2.3 Aborting a Rebase
If you encounter issues during rebase:
```bash
git rebase --abort
```
*Use case:* Return to the state before rebasing.

## 3. Interactive Rebasing

### 3.1 What is Interactive Rebase?
Interactive rebase allows you to edit, squash, reorder, or drop commits, providing a powerful way to curate commit history.

### 3.2 Running Interactive Rebase
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```
Replace `n` with the number of previous commits you want to edit.

### 3.3 Common Actions in Interactive Rebase:
- **pick:** Use the commit.
- **reword:** Edit the commit message.
- **edit:** Modify the commit content.
- **squash:** Combine commit with the previous one.
- **drop:** Remove the commit.

**Example:** Squashing multiple commits into a single commit:
```plaintext
pick 1234abc Initial commit
squash 5678def Added feature X
squash 9abc012 Fixed bug in feature X
```

After saving, Git will prompt you to edit the combined commit message.

## 4. Advanced Rebasing Scenarios

### 4.1 Rebase onto a Specific Commit
```bash
git rebase --onto <new-base> <upstream> <branch>
```
*Use case:* Move a sequence of commits to a different base.

### 4.2 Reapplying Commits from Another Branch
```bash
git rebase <target-branch>
```
*Use case:* Update your current branch with commits from another branch.

### 4.3 Rebasing and Skipping Commits
If a commit isnâ€™t necessary:
```bash
git rebase --skip
```

## 5. Rebasing vs. Merging

| **Aspect**      | **Rebase**                           | **Merge**                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **History**     | Linear, clean                        | Retains full branch history         |
| **Commits**     | Reapplies commits sequentially        | Creates merge commits               |
| **Conflicts**   | Resolved during rebase process        | Resolved at merge time              |
| **Usage**       | Local branch syncing, history editing| Collaborative integration, releases |

> **Recommendation:** Use rebase for local work and merge for integrating long-lived branches.

## 6. Best Practices for Git Rebasing

- **Never Rebase Public History:** Avoid rebasing commits that others rely on.
- **Use Interactive Rebase for Clean Commits:** Combine and edit commits before sharing.
- **Pull with Rebase:** Maintain linear history during pulls.
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```
- **Test After Rebase:** Ensure functionality after rebasing to catch any issues.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Rebase Issues

### 7.1 Rebase Conflicts Persist
- Double-check all conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
- After resolving conflicts:
```bash
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
```

### 7.2 Rebase Stuck on a Commit
- Edit the commit or skip:
```bash
git rebase --skip
```

### 7.3 Accidentally Completed a Problematic Rebase
- Use reflog to recover:
```bash
git reflog
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## 8. Real-World Use Cases

- **Feature Integration:** Rebase a feature branch before opening a pull request.
- **History Simplification:** Squash multiple commits after iterative development.
- **Collaboration:** Keep personal branches updated without cluttering commit history.
- **Fork Synchronization:** Rebase forks with upstream repositories.

---

## Summary

- **Basic Rebase:** `git rebase main`
- **Interactive Rebase:** `git rebase -i HEAD~n`
- **Abort Rebase:** `git rebase --abort`
- **Pull with Rebase:** `git pull --rebase`

Mastering Git rebase empowers developers to maintain clean project histories, simplify collaboration, and streamline development processes.
