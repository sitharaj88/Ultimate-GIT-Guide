# Git Cleanup: Optimizing Your Repository for Performance and Efficiency

This guide explores **Git Cleanup** techniques to keep your repository clean, efficient, and performant. Regular cleanup prevents unnecessary bloat, removes outdated references, and ensures that your Git environment runs smoothly.

## 1. Understanding Git Cleanup

### 1.1 What Is Git Cleanup?

**Git Cleanup** refers to the process of removing unnecessary files, branches, and objects from a Git repository. It ensures that the repository remains efficient by clearing outdated or unused data.

### 1.2 Why Git Cleanup Is Important
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces repository size and speeds up Git commands.
- **Minimized Conflicts:** Removes obsolete branches and references.
- **Easier Navigation:** Keeps project history clear and manageable.
- **Storage Optimization:** Deletes unreferenced files and objects.

> **Tip:** Regular cleanup prevents long-term performance issues in large repositories.

## 2. Cleaning Up Local Repositories

### 2.1 Removing Untracked Files
- **Dry run:** Preview what will be deleted:
  ```bash
  git clean -n
  ```
- **Force removal:** Delete untracked files:
  ```bash
  git clean -f
  ```
- **Remove directories:**
  ```bash
  git clean -fd
  ```
- **Remove ignored files:**
  ```bash
  git clean -fx
  ```

### 2.2 Pruning Stale References
- **Prune unreachable objects:**
  ```bash
  git gc --prune=now
  ```
- **Remove old reflog entries:**
  ```bash
  git reflog expire --expire=30.days --all
  ```

### 2.3 Deleting Local Branches
- **Delete a local branch:**
  ```bash
  git branch -d branch-name
  ```
- **Force delete (if not merged):**
  ```bash
  git branch -D branch-name
  ```

## 3. Cleaning Up Remote Repositories

### 3.1 Pruning Remote-Tracking Branches
- **Prune branches that no longer exist on the remote:**
  ```bash
  git fetch -p
  ```

### 3.2 Deleting Remote Branches
- **Delete a branch from the remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete branch-name
  ```

### 3.3 Syncing Remotes with Local Repository
- **Fetch and prune in one command:**
  ```bash
  git remote prune origin
  ```

## 4. Advanced Git Cleanup Techniques

### 4.1 Garbage Collection
- **Optimize storage and clean unnecessary files:**
  ```bash
  git gc --aggressive --prune=now
  ```
*Use case:* For repositories with extensive history or large binary files.

### 4.2 Removing Large Files from History
- **Using BFG Repo-Cleaner:**
  ```bash
  bfg --delete-files *.zip
  ```
- **Rewriting history with filter-repo:**
  ```bash
  git filter-repo --invert-paths --path <large-file>
  ```

### 4.3 Clearing Credential Cache
- **Remove stored credentials:**
  ```bash
  git credential-manager-core erase
  ```

## 5. Best Practices for Git Cleanup

- **Regular Cleanups:** Schedule periodic repository maintenance.
- **Use `.gitignore` Effectively:** Prevent unwanted files from being tracked.
- **Delete Merged Branches:** Regularly remove fully merged feature branches.
- **Monitor Repository Size:** Use tools like `git-sizer` to analyze repository health.
- **Backup Before Cleanup:** Especially when performing aggressive operations.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Git Cleanup Issues

### 6.1 Accidental Deletion
- **Recover with Reflog:**
  ```bash
  git reflog
  git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>
  ```

### 6.2 Repository Size Still Large
- **Check for large files:**
  ```bash
  git rev-list --objects --all | sort -k 2 > allfileshas.txt
  ```
- **Remove using BFG:**
  ```bash
  bfg --delete-files <file-name>
  ```

### 6.3 Broken History After Cleanup
- **Reset to stable state:**
  ```bash
  git reset --hard origin/main
  ```

### 6.4 Incomplete Remote Pruning
- **Manually prune remotes:**
  ```bash
  git remote prune origin
  ```

## 7. Real-World Use Cases

- **Enterprise Repositories:** Regular cleanup to maintain performance at scale.
- **Open-Source Projects:** Keep history clear and repository size manageable for contributors.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Optimize repositories for faster build times.
- **Legacy Projects:** Remove obsolete branches and large files from older codebases.

---

## 8. Summary

- **Remove Untracked Files:** `git clean -f`
- **Prune Stale References:** `git fetch -p` and `git gc --prune=now`
- **Delete Old Branches:** Locally with `git branch -d` and remotely with `git push origin --delete`.
- **Optimize Storage:** Use `git gc --aggressive` and BFG for large file cleanup.

Git cleanup ensures that repositories remain performant, storage-efficient, and free of unnecessary clutter. Regular maintenance, combined with effective Git commands, keeps development workflows running smoothly.
