# Staging and Committing Changes in Git

This guide covers how to stage changes and commit them in Git. These steps are fundamental for tracking progress in your project, collaborating with others, and maintaining a clean history of modifications.

---

## 1. Understanding Staging and Committing

- **Staging (`git add`):** Prepares changes to be included in the next commit. Think of it as selecting files you want to save at a particular checkpoint.
- **Committing (`git commit`):** Saves the staged changes to the repository history with a descriptive message.

> **Tip:** Use clear and meaningful commit messages to describe your changes.

## 2. Staging Changes

### 2.1 Staging a Single File:
```bash
git add filename.ext
```

### 2.2 Staging Multiple Files:
```bash
git add file1.ext file2.ext
```

### 2.3 Staging All Changes:
```bash
git add .
```

### 2.4 Staging Parts of a File:
```bash
git add -p filename.ext
```
This command allows you to interactively select portions of the file to stage.

### 2.5 Checking Staged Files:
```bash
git status
```

## 3. Committing Changes

### 3.1 Creating a Commit with a Message:
```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### 3.2 Committing All Changes in One Step:
```bash
git commit -am "Commit message"
```
> **Note:** The `-a` option stages changes for all tracked files before committing.

### 3.3 Writing Multi-line Commit Messages:
```bash
git commit
```
This will open the default editor for a detailed commit message.

---

## 4. Amending the Last Commit

### 4.1 Update the Most Recent Commit:
```bash
git commit --amend
```
This command allows you to change the last commit message or add newly staged changes to it.

### 4.2 Changing Only the Commit Message:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
```

> **Warning:** Amending should only be done for commits that haven't been pushed.

---

## 5. Unstaging Changes

### 5.1 Unstage a File:
```bash
git reset HEAD filename.ext
```

### 5.2 Unstage All Files:
```bash
git reset
```

### 5.3 Restore Changes to a File:
```bash
git checkout -- filename.ext
```
> **Caution:** This discards changes that haven't been committed.

---

## 6. Viewing Commit History

### 6.1 Basic Commit Log:
```bash
git log
```

### 6.2 One-line Commit History:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### 6.3 Graphical Representation:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

---

## 7. Best Practices for Staging and Committing

- **Commit Often:** Small, frequent commits make tracking changes easier.
- **Write Clear Messages:** Describe the "what" and "why" of your changes.
- **Group Related Changes:** Stage and commit logically related updates together.
- **Review Before Committing:** Use `git diff` and `git status` to check your work.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Staging and Committing Issues

### 8.1 No Changes Added to Commit:
- Ensure files are staged with `git add` before committing.

### 8.2 Commit Rejected (Non-Fast-Forward):
- Run `git pull --rebase` to integrate changes from the remote.

### 8.3 Accidentally Committed Wrong Files:
- Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to uncommit changes while keeping them staged.

---

## Summary

- **Staging (`git add`)** selects changes for the next commit.
- **Committing (`git commit`)** records changes permanently with a message.
- Use `git status` and `git log` regularly to monitor and review your progress.

With these staging and committing skills, you can maintain a clean, organized, and informative Git history.
