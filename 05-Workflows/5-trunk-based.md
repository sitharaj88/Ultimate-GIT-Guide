# Trunk-Based Development Workflow: Driving Fast and Reliable Releases

This guide explains the **Trunk-Based Development (TBD) Workflow**, its unique benefits, and how to implement it effectively. TBD is ideal for teams aiming for continuous integration and deployment, enabling rapid feedback, high-quality code, and minimal merge conflicts.

## 1. Understanding Trunk-Based Development

### 1.1 What Is Trunk-Based Development?

**Trunk-Based Development** is a Git workflow where developers work in short-lived branches (or directly on the `main` branch, known as the trunk). Changes are integrated into the trunk multiple times daily, ensuring the `main` branch remains stable and ready for release at all times.

### 1.2 Key Principles of Trunk-Based Development:
- **Single Source of Truth:** The `main` branch is always deployable.
- **Frequent Integration:** Developers merge changes at least once daily.
- **Small Commits:** Changes are small and incremental, reducing integration complexity.
- **Feature Toggles:** Incomplete features are hidden using feature flags, allowing deployment without waiting for full feature completion.

> **Tip:** TBD is the backbone of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) practices.

## 2. Setting Up Trunk-Based Development

### 2.1 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
*Use case:* Get the latest stable version of the project.

### 2.2 Create Short-Lived Branches (Optional)
```bash
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
```
*Use case:* Implement a small, well-scoped change.

### 2.3 Make Changes and Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the small change"
```
*Use case:* Ensure commits are small, focused, and meaningful.

### 2.4 Rebase Regularly
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```
*Use case:* Keep the feature branch up-to-date and reduce merge conflicts.

### 2.5 Merge Frequently
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge <feature-branch>
git push origin main
```
*Use case:* Integrate changes promptly to avoid divergence.

## 3. Key Practices in Trunk-Based Development

### 3.1 Feature Toggles
- Use feature flags to hide incomplete functionality:
```javascript
if (featureFlagEnabled("newFeature")) {
  // New feature code
} else {
  // Old feature code
}
```
*Use case:* Deploy unfinished features safely.

### 3.2 Continuous Integration (CI)
- Integrate automated testing and builds for every commit:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions CI workflow
tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```

### 3.3 Code Reviews on Small Changes
- Conduct fast and focused code reviews, emphasizing quality and clarity.

## 4. Advantages of Trunk-Based Development

- **Rapid Feedback:** Small changes merged regularly surface issues faster.
- **Minimal Merge Conflicts:** Frequent integration reduces complex merges.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Always-ready trunk supports fast releases.
- **Improved Team Collaboration:** Encourages consistent communication and collaboration.
- **Higher Code Quality:** Short feedback loops help maintain clean, tested code.

---

## 5. Limitations of Trunk-Based Development

- **Discipline Required:** Demands consistent merging and rigorous testing.
- **Complex Feature Management:** Requires effective use of feature toggles for incomplete work.
- **CI/CD Dependence:** Needs robust pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Trunk-Based Development

- **Merge Daily:** Integrate changes into `main` at least once per day.
- **Automate Everything:** Set up CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
- **Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before coding features.
- **Use Feature Flags Wisely:** Toggle incomplete features without affecting production.
- **Pair Programming:** Foster real-time code reviews and knowledge sharing.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 7.1 Merge Conflicts
- Rebase frequently and resolve conflicts immediately:
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### 7.2 Broken Builds
- Always run tests locally before pushing.
- Use CI pipelines to prevent faulty merges:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and Test
        run: npm run build && npm test
```

### 7.3 Long-Lived Branches
- Break large features into smaller tasks.
- Integrate partial functionality using feature toggles.

## 8. Real-World Use Cases

- **High-Frequency Deployments:** SaaS platforms releasing updates multiple times a day.
- **Agile Teams:** Agile workflows requiring continuous feedback and fast iterations.
- **Microservices Architectures:** Services requiring independent, continuous updates.
- **DevOps Pipelines:** Teams using automated pipelines for deployment and testing.

---

## Summary

- **Clone and Sync:** `git clone <repo>` and `git pull --rebase origin main`
- **Small, Frequent Changes:** Implement and merge small changes daily.
- **Feature Toggles:** Hide incomplete features for safe deployments.
- **Automated CI/CD:** Ensure continuous testing and deployment with robust pipelines.

Trunk-Based Development accelerates delivery cycles, reduces integration issues, and fosters a culture of collaboration and quality. It is the preferred workflow for modern, high-velocity software teams.
